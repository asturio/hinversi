What is "Hinversi"?
==================
Hinversi is my implementation of "Reversi" or the game "Othello". My Name is
Claudio, and "claudicare" means in latin "to limp", which is in German
"hincken". So the name of my implementation was named "hincken+reversi" or
shorter "hinversi".

How are the rules
=================
The object of othello is to flip as many of your opponent's tiles to your
color as possible without your opponent flipping your tiles. This is done by
trapping your opponent's tiles between two tiles of your own color.

The board starts with four tiles arranged in a box on the middle of the board.
The tiles have the same color at each corner. Black goes first and places a
tile on the board such that it traps white's tiles between two of black's
tiles. When black places a tile on the board all of white's tiles between
black's newly placed tile and another black tile, in a horizontal, vertical, or
diagonal row, are flipped over and become black. When there is tile trapped
between two tiles, of an identical color in the same row, the player captures
tiles until another tile of the player's color is encountered in. The player
can only take tiles that are a direct result of the placing a tile on the
board. Once a tile is placed on the board the player cannot remove it and place
the tile somewhere else. If a player cannot move they forfeit their turn. The
game ends when it is no longer possible for either player to move. 

How to start the game
=====================
You have just some simple options to start with it, you can select the how is
playing black with -b, who is playing white with -w. -h gives you a list of
possible options. The default white player is David (1) and the default black
player is Human (h). The AI-Player are
0 - Naivus      - A random engine
1 - David       - A look-one-move-ahead AI-engine
2 - Neo	        - An alpha-beta AI-engine
3 - ElMatador   - Another alpha-beta AI-engine, faster and stronger
